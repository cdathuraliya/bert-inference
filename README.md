A helper class for Google BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) to support online prediction and model pipelining. Check Jupyter Notebook for the demo. Before running, clone [BERT repo](https://github.com/google-research/bert) into the root directory. Check the pull request [#327](https://github.com/google-research/bert/pull/327) for `Sst2Processor` class. Place actual model files (`ckpt`) under `models` directory.
